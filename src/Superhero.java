//Matilda stops a superhero film she’s watching at home and checks Derek’s message. She finds it interesting, but she still likes more the film she’s enjoying.
//        Follow the instructions below:
//        . Create the Superhero interface. It has the getName method that returns a String.
//        . Create the Batman, Superman and Spiderman classes that implement the Superhero interface. Implement the getName methods with the help of Intellij in each one of them.

public interface Superhero {
    String getName();
}
